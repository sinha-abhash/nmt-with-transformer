# Neural Machine Translation with Transformer

- It is practice project adapted from [Tensorflow version](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer).
- As in Tensorflow tutorial, I also worked with Portuguese-English dataset.
- Implemented using:
  - Python 3.10.6
  - Tensorflow 2.11.0
  - Matplotlib 3.6.3


- **NMT with Transfomers.ipynb** contains exact same code as given in the tutorial, while the project nmt_with_transformer has been adapted according to Python project structure.
